## Install Swetrix
See the API installation process at https://github.com/Swetrix/swetrix-api#readme. \
To selfhost the frontend part of Swetrix, you simply need to set up `.env` variables, install the dependencies (`npm i`), build the code (`npm run build:css` and `npm run build` commands) and host it as a regular React application ([how to host react apps](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/)).\
On production, swetrix.com uses Cloudflare Pages to host the frontend part of the application.
